# Introduction to essential packages in R for Data Science
First of all, we will familiarize ourselves with the "packages" concept in `R`. `R` packages are collections of functions and data sets developed by one specific person or community. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones. 

One of the biggest strengths of `R` is that it is an open project. As a result, everyone can create their own packages/suites of packages and upload to the official `R`'s reporitory, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Recently, CRAN has reached 10,000 packages published, and many more are publicly available through the internet. 

This repository helps to cover some, or more ambitiously most of the packages necessary when it comes to dealing with datasets. Applying the philosophy of Hadley Wickham, this is an opiniated suites of packages that helps finish as many steps as possible in any customized workflow, with the highest proficiency. 

# Structure of the repository

The repository is organized by packages (suites of packages), followed by its sub-packages.

The first part of this repository will be dedicated to cover `tidyverse`, an opiniated sets of packages designed for data science. The tutorials include an overview of the suit, along with separate tutorials for each of the packages of its core. Finally, there will be some projects applying all of the function from different packages, as a complete work flow.
